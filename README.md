# Word Definition API

A simple project to demonstrate how to get word definitions using the [Dictionary API](https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/).

## Project Description

This project provides a straightforward way to fetch word definitions from the Dictionary API. You can query the API to get definitions, phonetics, origins, and more details about a word.

This project does not require any installation. You can directly use the API via HTTP requests. However, if you want to run a sample code, ensure you have Python and the `requests` library installed.

To install the `requests` library, run:
